=== 1.0.3 / 2008-06-21

* Removed the need to all Entrails.apply after load.  Now it just automatically extends the base classes if
  they exist.  If you want to run a single piece of Entrails, just require it before the Rails initializer. 

=== 1.0.2 / 2008-06-20

* Fixed the bug.  Now its usable.  I need to document though.  This really should be version 0.x.x  Oh well!
